# key technologies
## google file system (GFS)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System

http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf SOSP 2003. We have designed and implemented the Google File System, a scalable distributed file system for large distributed data-intensive applications. It provides fault tolerance while running on inexpensive commodity hardware, and it delivers high aggregate performance to a large number of clients.

## map reduce
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce

http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/es/us/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf  OSDI 2004. MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets.

## big table
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable

http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf  OSDI 2006. Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers.

## Dremel
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dremel_(software)

http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/36632.pdf  VLDB 2010. Dremel is a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only nested data.
